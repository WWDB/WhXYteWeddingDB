	CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW Donor_Name_Test AS SELECT Person.Person_ID, Person.First_Name, Person.Last_Name FROM Person INNER JOIN Donation_Item ON 		Donation_Item.Person_ID = Person.Person_ID<br>

TableView.js is currently hiding the Person_ID from the table, you can change this by editing line 47 in TestView.php
